ChangeLog
---------
*** IMPORTANT ***
As of version 1.2 GraPHPite has been refactored to support the PEAR standard. This has
(unfortunately) a large impact on existing users. Major changes to version 1.1 is:

 * All classes are now named according to PEAR naming scheme, i.e. Image_Graph_*
 * All class methods are sturdy caps i.e. Element::done(), Axis::forceMinimum()
 * Axis' are now returned via the Plotarea::getAxis() method
 * Add methods now return a reference to the object, instead of the "odd" way of creating
   global variables, i.e.:
     $Graph->addPlot(new Plot(), "Plot");
   is changed to:
     $Plot =& $Graph->addPlot(new Plot());
 * Coloring scheme changed so that named colors are now linked to a 24 bit integer value
   instead of the objects. setFillColor, setLineColor, setBorderColor and 
   setBackgroundColor instead of the corresponding -Style, to use the named colors). The
   colors are named according to the PEAR naming scheme: IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLOR], fx 
   IMAGE_GRAPH_RED
 * Include files are now named .php instead of .inc
 * File structure changed to accomodate PEAR structure
