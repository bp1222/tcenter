	* Documentation brush up
	* Added logarithmic axis
	* Tested with PHP5
	* License changed from GPL to LGPL	
	* Changed to accomodate PEAR standards
	  - All classes are now named according to PEAR naming scheme, i.e. Image_Graph_*
	  - All class methods are sturdy caps i.e. Element::done(), Axis::forceMinimum()
	  - Include files are now named .php instead of .inc
	  - File structure changed
	  - All private variables/methods are prefixed with a _ (should have no effect on usage since
	    they are (should be!) private)
	* Axis' are now returned via the Plotarea::getAxis() method
	* Add methods now return a reference to the object, instead of the "odd" way of creating
	  global variables, i.e.:
		$Graph->addPlot(new Plot(), "Plot");
      	  is changed to:
		$Plot =& $Graph->addPlot(new Plot());
	* Coloring scheme changed so that named colors are now linked to a 24 bit integer value
	  instead of the objects. setFillColor, setLineColor, setBorderColor and 
	  setBackgroundColor instead of the corresponding -Style, to use the named colors). The
	  colors are named according to the PEAR naming scheme: IMAGE_GRAPH_[COLOR], fx 
	  IMAGE_GRAPH_RED
