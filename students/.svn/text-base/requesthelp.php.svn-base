<tr><td>
<a name="owner"></a><b>Owner:</b><br>The owner of the machine is you. Your username will identify you and the machine you own. The entry box for the owner is disabled because the owner and <b>only</b> the owner should request assistance with this machine.<br><br>
<a name="description"></a><b>Description:</b><br>This should describe, in as few words as possible, what the machine you are bringing in looks like. This will help us quickly distinguish which machine is yours. It will also help you when you request assistance with this machine again. The next time you request assistance, the description of the machine will be available for you to choose so you do not have to enter the information for it again.<br><br>
<a name="serial"></a><b>Serial # or Service Tag:</b><br>These numbers are unique for all machines that are purchased from a vendor. This number will also help us uniquely identify your machine in the event two machines are of the same model. The serial # or service tag can most likely be found on the back of your machine on a little sticker (or under the front panel if you have a newer Dell machine). If you custom-built your machine, or had it custom-built, you might not have one of these numbers. If this is the case, then do not worry about it. Just put "n/a" in the field.<br><br>
<a name="mac"></a><b>MAC Address:</b><br>The MAC address is what RIT uses to uniquely identify your network card. It is also referred to as a "physical address". In Windows, click on "Start"->"Run", and type "command" and press "Enter." At the prompt, type "ipconfig/all". Look for the Physical Address in the form of "XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX". The MAC can be separated by either "-"s or ":"s. In Linux, type "ifconfig" at the prompt and look for "hwaddr". In Unix, type "ifconfig" at the prompt and look for "ether". The MAC address should follow in both cases.<br><br>
<a name="username"></a><b>Username To Log In With:</b><br>In order to work on your machine, we will need to log into it. You need to supply Resnet with an account on the machine that has <b>Administrative Privelages</b>. The username, in most cases, is the username you use to log into the machine on a daily basis.<br><br>
<a name="password"></a><b>Password for account:</b><br>It is extremely important that your user account has a strong password. This will prevent easy access to your machine, and in turn, make it much harder to compromise your machine. This password is required for Resnet to work on your machine as well. Please provide the password to the account you provide Resnet to log in with.<br><br>
<a name="items"></a><b>Items you are bringing:</b><br>In many occations, Resnet reinstalls software or Operating Systems for users. In order to do this, Resnet requires the media and licneses for those software and/or Operating System packages. If you are bringing any software, hardware, or cables with your machine, list them in as few words as possible.
